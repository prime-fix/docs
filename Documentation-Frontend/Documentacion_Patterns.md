### Design Patterns and Style Documentation

#### **Design Patterns**
1. **State Management with Signals**
   - Signals are used to manage local state in components. They are reactive and allow for predictable state transformations.
   - Example: A signal might hold the list of technicians, and a `computed()` function could filter the list based on a search query.
2. **Lazy Loading**
   - All feature modules are lazy-loaded to optimize performance. This means that the code for a module is only loaded when the user navigates to a route that requires it.
3. **Dependency Injection**
   - Services are injected using the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection. This approach simplifies testing and improves code readability.

#### **Style Guidelines**
- **Components**:
  - Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility. For example, a component should either display data or handle user input, but not both.
  - Use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` to optimize performance.
- **Templates**:
  - Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`) for simplicity and better readability.
  - Avoid `ngClass` and `ngStyle`; use `class` and `style` bindings instead.
