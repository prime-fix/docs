#### **Main Components**
1. **AutoRepairRegisterFormComponent**
   - **Responsibility**: This component provides a form for registering auto repairs. It is designed to handle user input and validate the data before submission.
   - **Location**: `src/app/auto-repair-register/presentation/views/auto-repair-register-form/`
   - **Features**:
     - Uses **Reactive Forms** for better scalability and validation. Reactive forms allow you to define the form structure in the component class, making it easier to manage complex forms.
     - Implements **input validation** to ensure that users provide correct and complete data. For example, fields like "Vehicle Model" or "Repair Date" might have required validators.
     - Optimized with `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` to improve performance by reducing unnecessary change detection cycles.
   - **Inputs**:
     - `repairData`: This input provides the initial data for the form. For example, if editing an existing repair record, this data will pre-fill the form fields.
   - **Outputs**:
     - `onSubmit`: This output emits an event when the form is submitted. The parent component can listen to this event to handle the submitted data.

2. **TechnicianListComponent**
   - **Responsibility**: Displays a list of available technicians. This component is responsible for showing the data in a user-friendly way and allowing users to interact with it (e.g., selecting a technician).
   - **Location**: `src/app/auto-repair-register/presentation/views/technician-list/`
   - **Features**:
     - Manages local state using **Angular Signals**, which are a modern and efficient way to handle state in Angular applications.
     - Includes **pagination** and **search functionality** to improve usability, especially when dealing with a large number of technicians.
   - **Inputs**:
     - `technicians`: This input provides the list of technicians to display. The data might come from a backend API.
   - **Outputs**:
     - `onSelect`: This output emits an event when a technician is selected. The parent component can use this event to perform actions like assigning the technician to a repair.

3. **VehicleStatusComponent**
   - **Responsibility**: Displays the current status of a vehicle. This component is useful for tracking the progress of repairs or diagnostics.
   - **Location**: `src/app/vehicle-status/presentation/views/`
   - **Features**:
     - Uses `computed()` for derived state calculations. For example, it might calculate whether a vehicle is "Ready for Pickup" based on its current status.
     - Supports **real-time updates** to ensure that the displayed data is always up-to-date. This might involve subscribing to a WebSocket or polling an API.
